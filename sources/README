1. Select a directory where to install the Varkon system
   and unzip and untar the distribution file into this
   directory. The distribution file tree has a top
   directory named varkon_1.18A. This will become
   the varkon root directory.

2. Make sure you have read and write privileges to all
   directories and files belonging to VARKON_ROOT.

3. cd to $VARKON_ROOT/sources

4. You might need to edit the makefile named "makefile"
   to reflect the name of your UNIX platform. "linux" is
   default so if you have a GNU/linux system  with gcc you
   don't need to change anything.  If you are running another
   UNIX system you have to change the PLATFORM variable in the
   makefile  accordingly.

5. The makefiles, by default, assume you have OpenGL
   includefiles and libs installed on your machine.
   If you have not, you can do one of the following:

     1. Download the Mesa 3D graphics library source
        distribution from http://www.mesa3d.org
        Mesa is a LGPL alternative for commersial versions
        of OpenGL that has proved to work fine with Varkon.
        If the "make_varkon" script (see below) complains
        about missing OpenGL includefiles or libraries
        check that the default directory for C includefiles
        on your system (/usr/include on many systems) 
        includes a directory named GL with files like 
        gl.h and glu.h etc. Also check that the default
        directory for C binary libraries (/usr/lib on
        many systems) include the two OpenGL libraries
        GL and GLU. With Mesa these will be named something
        like libMesaGL.so.3 and libMesaGLU.so.3. (These
        two files are also included in the binary version
        of Varkon for GNU/Linux in the VARKON_ROOT/bin
        directory.)
      
     2. Turn off support for OpenGL in the Varkon makefiles.

6.  If you want to build Varkon with support for ODBC,
    follow the instructions in the file README_ODBC in the
    sources directory. See the MBS manual pages for i"ODBC
    database routines" for instructions how to communicate
    with an external database.
 
7.  Run make by just typing 'make' in terminal window
    while you are positioned in the sources directory.
    Make will then build and install the new binaries. You
    might need a cup of coffe meanwhile....

8.  If this doesn't work, please contact us with a description
    of your problem. If you can supply us with a printout
    from make it helps a lot.

9.  Finally, follow the instructions in VARKON_ROOT/README
    to configure the system for your environment.

NOTE: Unlike some earlier versions of Varkon sources it is no
      longer needed to install the binary version of Varkon
      before you install the sources. The source distribution
      of 1.18A includes everything you need to build a 
      complete system except for OpenGL includefiles and libs.

      Note also that Varkon version 1.18A is not fully compatible
      with 1.17D or earlier versions. You can reuse MBS files
      from earlier versions but not MBO- or RES-files. See the
      releasenotes on the Varkon website for more info on this.
