The VU module contains a number of general utility routines
used by the DB and GE modules.

We decided to supply the VU module as a default replacement
for the original Varkon code in order to make it possible
to build the DB and GE module without including the rest
of the Varkon system.

All routines in the VU module are fairly simple and well
documented so it should be rather simple to replace them
with something of your own choice if you want to.

To make the VU module, cd to the VU/src directory and read
its README file.
